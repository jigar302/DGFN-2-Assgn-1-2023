In A_V_ Calc starter file. I wrote area and volume formulas for five different objects.
Firstly, I wrote formula for area of rectangle that is length into breadth. I use def function and mention area of rectangle and by using return I wrote formula for rectangle.
Then I wrote for square. The formula of square is equal to side length into side and I use the function as rectangle.
To make sure then I checked pytest for both. To check pytest first I import A_V_calc the as same as assertion task I put def assert and the calculation of the rectangle and square and put values and done calculation. At first attempt I got an error. The error is for calculation and then I fixed the error and my pytest ran for two.
Then I wrote formula for parallelogram that is breadth into height and use same function as above figures.
Then I wrote formula for cube and cuboid volume. The cube formula is side cube and for cuboid I used chat gpt for formula and I used the same function for them also.
Then I again test my pytest by inserting therse three in test file and I was successful in that.
Then I moved with my other part. First I started my main function with def main(): , below I wrote all print values.
In next step I used If , elif for the choices and use the float input to put the values of each function.
Then I used Q/q to quit the program.
Closed the function by using if main function as provided in assertion content in DC connect.Then I run the program I got the results.
I was not sure about the view mode So, I used the caht gpt by asking him question. How to calculate the view mode with calculations and I install that step and I was good to go.
At, last when I run the fuction. Firstly he asked level 0 values. Then the choice for calculation and then their values and then give the result.
If press V/v is level 0 it will give answer with equation. For example 3+2 = 5 (x+y = z). And if we press D/d it will give default calculations.
If I press Q/q it will exit the program. And by mistake I put wrong choice. I will get invalid choice.
